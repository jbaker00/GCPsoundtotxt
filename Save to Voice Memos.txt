I was just taking my break at lunch and I walked down the street about half a mile to this bakery that I really like the disease really fancy French pastries and they were all sold out and so I look across the street and like a Beacon of Hope I see a Dunkin Donuts and so I'm walking to the Dunkin Donuts and of course this is all in Santa Monica which I say at least 25% of the population is on house so I passed like 15 homeless people on my way to the Dunkin Donuts and none of them say anything except this one guy and he is mean they're all down on their luck but he is extremely down on his luck and like he's like this white guy you should he should be blonde but he basically was just all gray all over and he was like Hey excuse me ma'am sorry to bother you do you have a dollar could I have a dollar and I said I'm sorry I don't have any cash and he said that's okay and so I just kept walking and went got to the Dunkin Donuts and I went in and I had made my order and the lady gave me the wrong order and I said oh this is the wrong donut and then she was like oh you can keep that one I'll get you the right one too so then I had to do nuts so I'm walking back from work walking back from Dunkin Donuts back to work and the same guy is in the same place but now he's like in the opposite direction that I'm going and so I'm like am I really going to turn around walk all the way back up opposite direction cross the street just to give this guy a donut and then I said you know what yes I have to so I walked back up the street cross the street cross all the traffic went up to him and I said I know I said I didn't have any cash that I don't so I'm sorry but I do have a donut and it's yours if you want it and he just was so happy and see that's what it's like working in Santa Monica it's not fully gentrified yet you hear a lot of stuff like that but he was so happy and so grateful and so I gave him the extra Donuts so try to do something really nice today and go out of your way because who knows that might just change his whole am I not changed his life but it will certainly change his whole day around so that sounds like a pretty good deal okay bye
